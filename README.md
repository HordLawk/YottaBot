## Get started
Like any other bot, the `help` command will list all the other commands and using `help (command)` will show you the correct usage for a specified command, note that all commands have to be prefixed with your server's prefix ~~(duh)~~ and the default prefix is `y!`

It is recommended to first have a look at the `configs` command so you can customize the bot's behaviour to your liking before using its features

The default permission for any command is usually the closest normal Discord permission you would need to have to do whatever a command does without using the bot, for example, the default required permission for the `mute` command is Manage Roles, because that is the permission you would need to have to manually give the mute role to a member, however, you might not want to give this dangerous permission to every staff member you want to be able to mute people, in this case, the `perm` command will let you overwrite the default permission requirements for any command
